# py-tictactoe

## Description

`py-tictactoe` is a simple Python-based tic-tac-toe game that I created as a learning project. It is designed to help me understand the basics of building a game with some form of NPC using Python.

## Features

- Play tic-tac-toe against an NPC opponent
- Dark mode toggle for a different visual experience
- Simple GUI using the Tkinter library
- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for NPC moves
- Memoization for improved performance

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/py-tictactoe.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd py-tictactoe`
3. Run the game: `python .\src\main.py`

## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their symbol (X, non-selectable) on an empty cell.
- The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
